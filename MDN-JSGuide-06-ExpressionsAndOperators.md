## Operators

Javscript has the following types of operators:

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operators
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators


### Assignment operators

An **assignment operator** assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

Compound Assignment Operators 								Shorthand Operator
Assignment
Addition assignment
Substraction assignment
Multiplication assignment
Division assignment
Remainder assignment
Exponentiation assignment
Left shift assignment
Right shift assignment
Unsigned right shift assignment
Bitwise AND assignment
Bitwise XOR assignment
Bitwise OR assignment

#### Destructuring

With **destructuring assignment** syntax you can extract data from arrays or objects.

```javascript
var foo = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

// without destructuring
var one   = foo[0];
var two   = foo[1];
var three = foo[2];

// with destructuring
var [one, two, three] = foo;
```

### Comparison operators

You know the drill with these...

Comparison operators
- Equal
- Not equal
- Strict equal
- Strict not equal
- Greater than
- Greater than or equal
- Less than
- Less than or equal

### Arithmetic operators

An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.

Standard arithmetic operators are addition, substraction, multiplication and division. (Note that division by zero produces `Infinity`).

- Remainder
- Increment
- Decrement
- Unary negation
- Unary plus
- Exponentiation operator

### Bitwise operators

A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones). For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.
